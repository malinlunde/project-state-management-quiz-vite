# State Management Quiz

This assignment was a group project and the project was to build a quiz using zustand.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We added all the data to the store-file and then created different components where we rendered the data and linked everything together in parent-files. We used Figma for team decisions and for the design layout.
